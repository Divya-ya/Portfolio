        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome! My passion lies in software engineering, where I aim to contribute
            to innovative solutions within dynamic tech environments. This portfolio is 
            a testament to my dedication to coding, showcasing my growing skills in Python, 
            C++, HTML, CSS, basic SQL, and Java fundamentals. I'm also keenly interested in 
            automation, with hands-on experience and continuous learning in tools like Power 
            Automate, keen to contribute to streamlined and efficient systems. I'm always 
            eager to learn new technologies as per project requirements, ensuring I can 
            adapt and deliver effectively. I'm also exploring freelancing opportunities 
            because, well, good ideas shouldn't wait.
